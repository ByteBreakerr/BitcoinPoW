This Python script implements the Proof of Work algorithm commonly employed by cryptocurrencies, notably Bitcoin. It takes a target hash and a difficulty value as parameters and iteratively computes the nonce required to produce a hash that satisfies the specified difficulty level. The script utilizes a hashing function to generate candidate hashes, incrementing the nonce until a hash is found that meets or exceeds the target, thereby demonstrating the computational effort involved in the mining process.
